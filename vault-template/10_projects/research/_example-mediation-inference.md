# Semiparametric Inference for Mediation Effects

## 📋 Project Status
- [x] Literature review complete
- [x] Theory developed
- [x] Simulations designed
- [ ] Simulations run (in progress)
- [ ] Application identified
- [ ] Draft complete
- [ ] Internal review
- [ ] Submitted

## 🎯 Core Contribution
> Develop doubly robust estimators for natural direct and indirect effects that achieve semiparametric efficiency under minimal assumptions

## 📐 Key Results
1. **Theorem 1**: Influence function derivation for $\psi_{NDE}$ under the nonparametric model
2. **Theorem 2**: Double robustness property requires only one of two models to be correctly specified
3. **Corollary 1**: $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality under regularity conditions

## 📝 Notes

### Current Focus
Working on simulation study comparing performance of:
1. Parametric g-formula
2. IPW estimator
3. AIPW (our proposed method)
4. TMLE

### Next Steps
1. Complete simulation scenarios 4-6
2. Add real data application (JOBS II study)
3. Draft introduction section
4. Create figure comparing bias-variance tradeoff
