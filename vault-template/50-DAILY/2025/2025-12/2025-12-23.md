## 🎯 Today's Focus
- [x] Run simulation scenarios 4-6 for mediation manuscript
- [ ] Prepare lecture slides for STAT 579 Week 2
- [ ] Review RMediation package bug report #42

## 📝 Notes

### Research
Working on mediation inference manuscript. Simulation results looking promising - AIPW estimator shows substantial efficiency gains over IPW when outcome model is correctly specified. Need to add visualization comparing bias-variance tradeoff.

Meeting with Jane at 2pm to discuss real data application. She suggested using the JOBS II dataset which has good mediator measurement.

### Teaching
STAT 579 lecture prep for next week on mediation basics. Planning to cover:
1. Traditional Baron-Kenny approach (and its limitations)
2. Counterfactual framework
3. Identification assumptions
4. R implementation with `mediation` package

### Packages
Bug report on RMediation about confidence interval coverage for product of coefficients method. Looks like issue with delta method approximation in extreme tail cases. Need to investigate numerical stability.

## ✅ Completed Today
- [x] Fixed simulation code bug (scenario 4 sample size was wrong)
- [x] Updated Figure 2 with better color scheme
- [x] Responded to 3 GitHub issues

## 💭 Reflections
Good productive day. The simulation results are exceeding expectations. Need to remember to check on collaborative project with John - haven't heard from him in a week.
